Denoising kernels, multilayer perceptrons and autoencoders for electron microscopy

Fully trained autoencoders are available [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=13_xQvTOJqYu4WoEUF5lUiM4hAkYX4yM3).

Fully trained denoising kernels and MLPs are available [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1sweKWAL9quwAqIclgfM2d0Ia2-rgmu0Y)

Kerenel MLP files are labelled with with d<x>w<y>. These indicate the depths and widths of the kernels and MLPs the file stores parameters for. depth = hidden layers+1 so d1w3 is a simple kernel and input width 3 whereas d4w5 is a multilayer perceptron with 3 hidden layers and input width 5.
