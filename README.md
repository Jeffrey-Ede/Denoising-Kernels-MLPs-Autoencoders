This repository is in the works. A paper, more code, examples and more neural networks will be published here soon (by around the end of August).

Denoising kernels, multilayer perceptrons and autoencoders for electron microscopy

Autoencoders can be downloaded from  my Google Drive [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=13_xQvTOJqYu4WoEUF5lUiM4hAkYX4yM3).

Denoising kernels and MLPs can be downloaded from my Google Drive [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1sweKWAL9quwAqIclgfM2d0Ia2-rgmu0Y)

Kerenel MLP files are labelled with with d<x>w<y>. These indicate the depths and widths of the kernels and MLPs the file stores parameters for. depth = hidden layers+1 so d1w3 is a simple kernel and input width 3 whereas d4w5 is a multilayer perceptron with 3 hidden layers and input width 5.
